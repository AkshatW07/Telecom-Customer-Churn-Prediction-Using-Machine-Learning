# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning 

# Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecommunications industry, with annual churn rates often exceeding 10%. This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to predict whether a customer will churn or remain loyal based on customer usage patterns, service plans, and billing information.

# Business Objective
To develop a classification model that predicts customer churn (1 – Churn, 0 – No Churn) and helps telecom companies design effective customer retention strategies.
